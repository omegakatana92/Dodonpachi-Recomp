Description: what the shared arcade-decomp core (tools/core) needs to know of DoDonPachi
Version:     0.1.0
Created:     31-10-2026
Modified:    31-10-2026

The core is the same for every game; this module gives it DoDonPachi's ROM set, the names the
generated files carry, and the settings of Cave's first-generation 68000 board. Nothing here is
game data: the ROM is the player's.
